## About Smart Green House

Our Smart Greenhouse is designed to address the needs of modern agriculture with a focus on sustainability and efficiency. Utilizing an IoT-based system, we reduce resource usage, such as water and energy, while enhancing plant productivity. The integrated hydroponic and aeroponic systems enable soil-free cultivation, making it environmentally friendly and highly effective in limited spaces. This model is ideal for urban areas or regions with restricted land availability.

Additionally, this project serves as a research and development hub for students and researchers interested in modern agriculture. Data collected from IoT sensors supports ongoing research to refine cultivation methods and gain deeper insights into the factors that influence plant growth.

## Key Features:

Features :

- Automatic/Manual Environmental Control:
  Offers options to control temperature, humidity, and lighting either automatically or manually, ensuring optimal conditions for plant growth.

- Real-Time Monitoring:
  Equipped with smart sensors that track temperature, humidity, light levels, and water needs. Real-time data is displayed on the dashboard, enabling immediate monitoring and response.

- Data Analysis and Statistics:
  Collects data and displays it in statistical charts over selected time periods, helping users track trends and analyze plant performance over time.

- Alert System:
  Sends automatic notifications when specific conditions are reached, such as high temperatures or low humidity, allowing for timely adjustments.

- Energy Efficiency:
  Conserves energy and water by activating resources only when necessary, contributing to cost savings and sustainability.
