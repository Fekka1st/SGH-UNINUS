## About Smart Green House

Our Smart Greenhouse is designed to address the needs of modern agriculture with a focus on sustainability and efficiency. Utilizing an IoT-based system, we reduce resource usage, such as water and energy, while enhancing plant productivity. The integrated hydroponic and aeroponic systems enable soil-free cultivation, making it environmentally friendly and highly effective in limited spaces. This model is ideal for urban areas or regions with restricted land availability.

Additionally, this project serves as a research and development hub for students and researchers interested in modern agriculture. Data collected from IoT sensors supports ongoing research to refine cultivation methods and gain deeper insights into the factors that influence plant growth.

## Key Features:
